Hi! I'm Matt.

I'm a founder and lead technical contributor at the DevOps consulting company [Bitlancer](https://bitlancer.com), the MINDBODY solution provider [O2M Fitness](https://o2mfitness.com), and [Turnstyle](https://turnstylecycle.com) indoor cycling studios. I'm also a student pilot and co-founder of [Spread Aviation](https://spreadaviation.com), a growing aviation safety podcast and education company.

I love creating products and services that solve real problems and actually help people -- that's the driving force behind all my ventures.
