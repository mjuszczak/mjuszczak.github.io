title: "Processing Late Cancel & No Show Fees in MINDBODY"

This is the first of what I hope will become an ongoing series of MINDBODY tips & tricks. In my capacity as Co-Founder of [Turnstyle Cycle](https://www.turnstylecycle.com) and [O2M Fitness](http://o2mfitness.com), I'm constantly working with MINDBODY's software as both a business owner and consumer. Today's post is a bit of a selfish plug; however.

Almost all studios that use MINDBODY have a late cancel and/or no show fee for Unlimited members who fail to show to class. Up until recently, [processing these manually was required](https://support.mindbodyonline.com/s/article/Can-I-charge-for-a-late-cancel?language=en_US). For those who have access to MINDBODY, there was a huge support thread (now gone) full of requests for this functionality. Now, there's a way!

O2M recently launched our Studio Tools product, which allows MINDBODY fitness studios to automatically charge their customers for late canceling and/or failing to show to a class all-together. We built the first version of this at Turnstyle years ago, and decided to rebuild the software last year and offer it to other studios as a service. Check out the [O2M Studio Tools Late Cancel service](http://o2mfitness.com).

Cheers.
